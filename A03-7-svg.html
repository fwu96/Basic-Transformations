<h2>Workbook 3, page 7 - SVG Exercise</h2>
<p><img src="A03-7-svg.svg" style="border:2px solid darkred"></img></p>
<p>Above is a big SVG that is empty. It is file <code>A03-7-svg.svg</code>. Fill it in with an interesting picture (by editing that file).</p>
<p>You should make the picture by hand, i.e., edit the SVG in a text editor. Do not create or edit the picture in a picture editing tool (like Illustrator or InkScape).</p>
<p>Your picture should make use of hierarchical modeling. It should have groups, transformations, and instancing. There should be more than one <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> tags, as well as <code>&lt;g&gt;</code> (group) tags that have transformations attached.</p>
<p>It's OK if your picture only uses basic shapes, but it is also OK if you use this opportunity to learn more about SVG and use some more advanced features. </p>
<p>If you're stumped for ideas, you could try re-creating one of the Canvas pictures in the workbook (for example, the Windmills picture).</p>
<p>Technically, the picture in Box 4 of page 5 (the SVG example) would satisfy the requirements. You can refer to this picture (you have the source code), but please make your own picture.</p>
<p>We may award a bonus point for a really great picture that makes really great use of instancing to create something really complicated.</p>
<p>You should do this assignment by writing SVG. Don't use JavaScript to create the SVG. And make a static picture: while SVG has interaction and animation capabilities, usually these are done with JavaScript, and that gets away from the goals of this assignment.</p>
<p>This is the last page of the workbook. Don't forget to do the <code>QUESTIONS.md</code> page and fill in your <code>README.md</code>. And of course, commit and push to GitHub often!</p>
